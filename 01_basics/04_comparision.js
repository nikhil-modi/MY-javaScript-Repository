console.log("2" > 1);

// the equality check === and comparision "> < >=" works differently 
// comparision convert null to a number treating it as 0

console.log(null > 0);
console.log(null == 0);
console.log(null >= 0);

// that's why null>=0 is true and null>0 is false

// === this is called as strict check which also checks the datatypes
